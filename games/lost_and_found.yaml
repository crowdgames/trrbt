    comment: Items in STATE are listed line by line as LOCATION TYPE OBJECT_ID. Lines in GAME show the current results (R) of the previous action. Results can be descriptions (DESC OBJECT_ID; DESC OBJECT_ID CONTENTS), list descriptions (how an object would be presented in a list) (LIST_DESC OBJECT_ID), or actions (ACT ACTION OBJECT_ID),

          comment: DEVNOTE Why isn't there a token to just represent "I don't care WHAT it is, but I want to move whatever it is around the board" - like an inverse "." where I don't care what "." is and I don't want to affect it. Another issue is that x-replace only replaces all instances of the token with the same token only - not any combo. This is why I am forced to use "ANY_ACTION" and "ANY_THING" instead of just one "ANY".

                comment: Move action left until you hit the R DEVNOTE there's currently no way to say "anything EXCEPT R" so I accomplish this with the "." and the knowledge that the start of the row is R. So what we are actually doing is lhs "R .* DO ANY_ACTION ANY_THING .*" to rhs "R DO ANY_ACTION ANY_THING _*" (* being repeat-as-needed). For that matter, I don't care how many .s are between R and DO or how many are after ANY_THING. I just want to move it to the front of the line so I can then process it down to NOW for action processing.
